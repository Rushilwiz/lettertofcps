<h1>Dear FCPS School Board members and Virginia State Legislators,</h1>
<p>We, as current students of TJHSST, write to you in response to the merit lottery proposal for TJ admissions. From the first day we set foot into the school, we were welcomed to an extraordinary community which allowed us to pursue our passions and connect with those who shared our interests. We care deeply about TJ and its future, and while we acknowledge that the lack of diversity at our school is an urgent issue, this proposal is not the answer. The board&rsquo;s proposition is rushed, unfair, and stands against the values of TJ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current application process is race-blind, upholds the values of meritocracy, and seeks to determine the individuals who are the most passionate about STEM. While we understand that the current admissions process has many shortcomings, the new proposal fails to solve these issues and creates a plethora of new problems.</p>
<p>TJHSST is a unique community built on its passion for learning. We agree that everyone in Northern Virginia should be given a fair chance towards TJ&rsquo;s educational opportunities. The disadvantages that lower-income and minority students face arecreated far before an applicant sits down to take the TJ test, and that is the problem we, as a school, as a community, and as a state, need to address. In this letter, we detail alternative solutions that we feel would effectively help TJ demographics better reflect those of Fairfax County in the long term.</p>
<h1><strong>Concerns with the current proposal</strong></h1>
<p><em>The proposed lottery process was first introduced to the public on September 15th, with a decision required to be made on October 8th. We would like the board to recognize the ramifications of rolling out such a sweeping policy on such a short timeline.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>The proposal is rushed and largely fails to take into account the opinions of members of the TJ community.</strong></p>
<p>It was given three weeks in the public&rsquo;s eye, and we feel the timeline doesn&rsquo;t give an appropriate amount of time for the board to receive and process the much-needed community input that plays a crucial role in board proceedings. The board and state have both hosted a few &ldquo;town halls&rdquo; on virtual meeting platforms such as Zoom, which include minimal ways for community members to provide input on the proposal. These town halls have proven that the input provided during the meetings has been ignored, and hosts have explicitly stated that they will not be addressing questions posted in the Q&amp;A or chat box. We ask that the board commits to providing a better platform for students, parents, and other community members to provide their feedback and thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>The proposal is extremely vague.</strong></p>
<p>Almost no specific information is provided to the public. We do not know the weight of the SIS essays in the proposed admissions system, what the proposed &ldquo;questionnaires&rdquo; actually are, whether there are different priority lottery pathways, or if the lottery pathways are solely regional. Because these are not defined, those who support the lottery have no clear idea of what they are supporting. In addition, the lottery system is now subject to last-minute changes away from the public&rsquo;s eye, which is a poor decision considering the wide-spread implications of the system.</p>
<p><strong>The lottery systems examples are cherry-picked and largely inapplicable.</strong></p>
<p>The proposal lists five schools as evidence of high functioning lottery admission schools. Among them, BASIS Arizona is a charter school, bound to different state and local regulations. In addition, the lottery system fails to reflect diversity in the area. For example, at BASIS Arizona Chandler, 68% of students are Asian, compared to 3% in the surrounding area. Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science and Technology in Georgia has a total of 706 applicants for the lottery pool, in which 590 were admitted. They also require math end of course and SAT/PSAT cutoff scores to register. International Community School of Washington state does have a lottery admission system, but it occurs in 6th grade, not 9th grade where children's talents and abilities are much more defined. Loveless Academic Magnet Program High School has a total enrollment of only 514 students. Admissions is not just due to a lottery but also a review of academic records and completion of a personal interview. Raisbeck Aviation High School only takes 105 kids a year and is highly specialized. We find it disappointing that the current proposal cited schools simply for the fact that they have a lottery system without observing the specifics of the systems or the results those systems produced.</p>
<p><em>The proposed process removes aspects of the TJHSST application process which we believe are equitable measures of a student&rsquo;s success.</em></p>
<p><strong>Admissions testing is critical to select students who will thrive at TJ.</strong></p>
<p>The TJ experience is challenging for all students as many classes are extremely rigorous and require a strong drive for success. Admissions testing helps to select students who will be able to do well in these classes and succeed in the high-stress environment. The removal of a merit-based exam ignores the fact that the education quality across Fairfax County is not consistently rigorous, especially in core STEM classes such as Mathematics and Science. While the current admissions system is imperfect, removing it doesn&rsquo;t resolve the deep-rooted inequities within FCPS school systems.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>The current proposal adds a significant amount of random chance that is blind to student merit</strong>.</p>
<p>Although the merit lottery system offers an equal chance of admission, accepted candidates will not necessarily be the most qualified.Rather than artificially bolstering diversity at TJ through random chance, we should look to equalize applicant opportunities and chances of admission across all socioeconomic backgrounds <em>years before</em> the application process. A merit lottery system is likely to stigmatize disadvantaged students, insinuating that they were accepted because of chance, not qualifications or effort. Accepted applicants may feel as if their hard work in middle school did not positively affect their admission, while rejected applicants may feel that their spot was &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; by someone less qualified.[4]</p>
<p><strong>Creating a lottery creates an influx of applicants who are not a great fit for TJ. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;In January 2016, millions of Americans bought $2 or $3 Powerball tickets for a chance at claiming a $1.5 billion jackpot, the largest in US history. The players were not particularly intent on winning the lottery&mdash; most didn&rsquo;t expect to walk away as billionaires, but the potential reward incentivized them to enter. Similarly, the proposed merit lottery has the potential to discourage students from working hard to earn admission as it will attract-- and accept-- applicants who are not fully prepared for the rigorous courses and as a result will be unable to succeed at TJ. This will likely end up fostering a more stressful environment for the TJ community. Additionally, teachers go to amazing lengths to help students who seek their assistance and the school is built around assisting those that want further guidance and opportunities. Admitting more students who are not interested in taking advantage of these resources only breeds a sense of apathy about pursuing one&rsquo;s interests and working together to solve problems; it not only harms the very foundation this school is built on but also fails to help students or teachers.</p>
<p><strong>The merit lottery system may not increase diversity/representation.</strong></p>
<p>The current TJ demographic is extremely disproportionate to the surrounding population, but not due to the admissions process. The number of Black and Latinx students who apply to TJ is also disproportionately low compared to that of Asian and Caucasian applicants. Under the proposed system, county demographics will still not be properly reflected if the number of applicants from these populations stay low. Unfortunately, there is a lack of input around the county from historically underrepresented populations about their views on TJ. Under the current proposal, success would remain hollow even if applicant numbers were to rise because these disadvantaged populations are still not given the resources to thrive at TJ.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Teacher recommendations are one of the most equitable ways to understand a student beyond their test scores, and removing them is counterproductive.</strong></p>
<p>Students cannot take a prep class to show their passion for STEM to their teachers; the passion will be apparent to the teachers through extensive participation in class and the pursuit of complex subjects beyond the classroom. Letters of recommendation are also an essential way for students to demonstrate their aspirations and personality. Without this representation, students who demonstrate a passion for STEM but score poorly on tests would be overlooked during the application process. It is evident that teacher recommendations have many flaws; however, we do believe that they play a crucial part in any admissions process, and we&rsquo;d like the Board to move to work with teachers to improve the recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>The quota system will not solve the diversity issue at its TJ.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The regional quota system creates a synthetic version of diversity that only looks good on paper while creating additional problems. As it stands, TJ is an incredibly challenging environment for many. By enforcing a regional quota, many highly qualified students who deserve to attend TJ would lose the opportunity to attend the school and those unprepared to handle TJ&rsquo;s heavy coursework would be accepted. Furthermore, many students who come from schools which historically have had few TJ acceptances likely don&rsquo;t have the extensive exposure to STEM that feeder schools do and may not have heard of TJ much less apply. The combination of these two factors would lead to many struggling students and a hurt reputation in the eyes of minority groups, leading to fewer applications.</p>
<p>When academic readiness and diversity throughout the county overlap, diversity within TJ will happen naturally. Instead of enforcing artificial quotas, we should seek to improve educational equity throughout the entire county. Diversity is not a number, it is an environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality is,. Creating a quota to include more students from schools which have historically failed to produce many TJ acceptances does nothing to address this issue, meaning the number of applicants from these schools will continue to stay low compared to that of feeder schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regional quotas give some applicants an unfair advantage based on where they live and may have consequences beyond diversity at TJ.</strong></p>
<p>The current proposal&rsquo;s lottery pathways have been organized in such a way that many schools with historically high TJ acceptance rates are grouped together (for example, Carson and Cooper in Region 1 and Longfellow and Kilmer in Region 2) while schools that traditionally do not produce as many TJ acceptances have far less competitive regional pathways. This leads to more qualified applicants being rejected from TJ while those who are less qualified would be accepted, simply because they live in a different region. Furthermore, as parents realize that living in a certain place could mean that their child would be at a disadvantage may cause them to move away from the place. This may have economic implications as well: as individuals move away from a certain area, many local businesses (even outside of those directly affected such as prep classes) within that area would subsequently suffer from the decrease in patronage.</p>
<h1><strong>Our proposals</strong></h1>
<p><em>The most effective solution to a lack of diversity at TJ would be to level the playing field for disadvantaged students far earlier. Yes, this proposal requires significant investment in schools that serve disadvantaged students. Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it will take more time than eliminating the admissions standards for TJ. Altering the TJ admissions process to a lottery is a band-aid solution that fixes the problem on paper, but the inherent problem of educational inequity is still maintained throughout the county, and it&rsquo;s hard to treat a bullet wound with a band-aid. We believe that our proposals will help to mitigate the overarching problem in the long term, increasing TJ&rsquo;s diversity while maintaining the educational excellence that makes TJ special.</em></p>
<p><strong>Increase targeted recruitment for TJ applicants at all regional middle schools</strong></p>
<p>While we applaud the board for discussing the need for this change, we would like to iterate more specific solutions. Many middle schools, particularly those in low-income areas, barely mention TJHSST applications, and schools that neglect to talk about TJ are doing a disservice to students who truly have a passion for STEM and would benefit from a rigorous high-level education like TJ. To significantly increase awareness of the possibility of applying to TJ, the Fairfax County School Board should consider making admission outreach mandatory for all middle schools in the county. Our proposal for implementing this is to have TJ student ambassadors be part of the outreach process, and help encourage middle schoolers, especially those that do not send many students to TJ, to apply. Further, information about admissions deadlines and content should be given directly to the student through their FCPS email.</p>
<p><strong>Remove the groupings based on &ldquo;capability&rdquo; between AAP and Gen-Ed in the early grades</strong></p>
<p>Separation based on intellect starts very early on in the public school process, as early as 1st and 2nd grades when students are divided into the Advanced Academics Program (AAP) and General Education (Gen-Ed). Teachers often state without any constraint that AAP students are expected to be &ldquo;more capable&rdquo; and learn at a &ldquo;faster pace&rdquo;. Additionally, despite the IOWA being required to be administered for everyone in the AAP program in 6th grade, it is not required for the Gen-Ed students. Some students are not even aware that the IOWA can be administered to students not enrolled in AAP. This single distinction prevents many students from applying to TJ and succeeding on the admissions test as passing the IOWA is required to take Algebra I in seventh grade, which is a prerequisite for getting into TJ. Those who take Algebra I in eighth grade are eligible to apply; however, the math portion of the test requires some Algebra I knowledge, which they have not fully learned by the time of the test. Overall, non-AAP students are at a much greater disadvantage because of a distinction made early on, and the program leaves students limited in which classes they can take, preventing them from being best prepared to apply to and thrive at TJ.</p>
<p>Additionally, empirical studies done of FCPS indicate that the Gen-Ed students are often of ethnic minorities: 19% of the students in FCPS are eligible for level 4, but only 12% of black students and 7%[3] of Latinx students are included in this group<strong>. </strong>Unlike the current proposal for changing TJ admissions, this attacks the underlying problems and is built on providing equal opportunity rather than having random admission. Doing this will make the TJ admissions process more inclusive in the long term and will also help increase educational equity in FCPS as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Collect meaningful data from the minorities around the county about their views on TJ.</strong></p>
<p>The current proposal is, at best, a rushed decision without consideration of a significant amount of data. The highlight of the proposal seems to be that everything else has failed, but the universal problem is the lack of communication with those to whom it pertains. There have been some weak attempts to help create opportunities to help boost minority acceptance rates, but they were so poorly advertised that most FCPS students have never heard of them. Students in schools with fewer resources have never been asked how they view TJ or even if they have heard of TJ. We make our best decisions when they are driven by data. This lack of data regarding the merit lottery system is significant since the lack of admissions for students of color could very likely be due to a lack of applicants. This means that the current system is most likely to inflate the white student populations while deflating the Asian populations, becoming almost the exact opposite of the goal. Simultaneously, it would guarantee that heavy feeder schools like Rachel Carson Middle School, where TJ is made commonly known to the students, would maintain its dominant feeder status.</p>
<p><strong>Provide students with more opportunities and resources that they can use to help with schoolwork</strong></p>
<p>Many students in higher-income neighborhoods have parents who attended higher-level education and can assist students with their coursework by teaching them or paying for classes. Not everyone&rsquo;s parents can teach or afford STEM classes, so this puts some students at a disadvantage as there are fewer opportunities for one-on-one help. In middle schools particularly, there should be more opportunities for students to get tutoring with their teachers outside of school hours. We recognize that many teachers do not have the time to hold these tutoring sessions out of school hours, so an alternative for those teachers would be to have older students, whether they be high schoolers or middle schoolers, tutor younger students who feel they need the help. Additionally, teachers (especially those who teach STEM classes) should increase awareness of free websites and resources that could help the students understand the content and delve deeper into the subject. If sufficient resources to enrich students&rsquo; learning were made available to all who wanted to access them, then a fair admissions test would be much more effective at testing students&rsquo; empirical knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Encourage and fund STEM and TJ Prep programs in middle and elementary schools with higher populations of disadvantaged students.</strong></p>
<p>Just like with varsity sports, the slots should go to the most qualified students. For TJ, that currently heavily favors those who have the resources to prepare for the test and while you can certainly make the test less preparable, no one will be able to eliminate the advantage that these students have. To address this issue, FCPS could run free TJ &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; classes and other STEM classes at schools (much like paid test preparation classes) through organizations such as ACE and Global Plus. By funding more free programs in FCPS schools for students without these resources, you can give resources to disadvantaged students to help them be able to properly prepare for the tests and ensure that all the students that walk in on test day do so on an equal playing field and offers are given to students who truly have the greatest potential to succeed at TJ.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Encourage the creation of equitable extracurricular STEM activities across all schools in FCPS.</strong></p>
<p>Educational seminars should be held by current TJ student volunteers at underserved elementary and middle schools. In addition, FCPS should add enrichment clubs to underserved schools, such as rocketry, chess, and math clubs. FCPS has consistently said that these clubs are &ldquo;run by parents, not the schools.&rdquo; While it is true that these clubs have historically been run by parent groups, that is precisely the source of the problems and disparities. At privileged schools, there are many engaged parents who have the free time to volunteer. At schools where there might be more single parents and/or more parents working multiple jobs, adults have less time to spare. Therefore, it stands to reason that schools with less parent involvement will be underserved and disadvantaged. FCPS needs to take ownership of this issue and run some bare minimum level of clubs at each school when there is insufficient parental volunteerism to support these programs. Whether these clubs are run by paid instructors, teacher volunteers, student volunteers from other schools, community organizations, ACE, Global Plus, IFTE, or other qualified individuals and organizations, a solution needs to be found to provide equal access to participate in STEM extracurriculars for all students.</p>
<p><strong>Create public makerspaces for STEM work.</strong></p>
<p>One of the reasons people have pointed out for feeling unwelcome or disadvantaged in STEM learning is that they had fewer opportunities to pursue STEM activities before middle and high schools. If Fairfax County can host public maker spaces for STEM, it will introduce people to STEM activities at a younger age and allow them to discover their passions. This will allow them to develop STEM skills at their own pace and realize if they want to pursue TJ from early on.</p>
<p><em>While an admissions test is necessary, the current admissions test is flawed. Wealthier TJ applicants often attend private tutoring classes to prepare for the TJ admissions test. Creating a test that measures critical thinking, logic, and creative problem solving instead of standardized testing skills would help to eliminate the advantage that students who pay for private tutoring have. This was implemented for the Class of 2022 admissions with the introduction of the Quant-Q, and we saw noticeable differences in class demographics. We should continue in this direction.</em></p>
<p><strong>Create a portion of the admissions test where students must learn a new concept and apply their knowledge to solve given problems.</strong></p>
<p>One way we could make the admissions test less preparable would be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students are given a concept to learn (20 - 30 minutes). This concept must be one not typically taught in schools.</li>
<li>Students are given a problem, and students create a solution based on the new concepts.</li>
</ol>
<p>This idea can be applied to a wide range of topics, especially those in STEM fields. For example, students could learn about encryption techniques, practice decryption, and then use that knowledge to decrypt codes. Students could also learn about architecture techniques and then build a structure using given materials that accomplishes a given goal and satisfies certain constraints.</p>
<p>Many prestigious math competitions (ex. ARML, PuMAC, CMIMC) use a version of this testing structure in a round known as power rounds, where competitors must solve--and usually show their work for-- problems regarding a scenario, often without being able to use conventional mathematical formulas and instead of having to largely rely on their problem-solving skills. Additionally, the well-known national competition Science Olympiad holds events of this nature, such as the Experimental Design event, where students are given materials and a previously unknown question/topic to address and must then design, conduct, and analyze the results of an experiment. Finally, the Future Problem Solving Program International organizes a competition called Global Issues Problem Solving where students are informed of the question topic prior to but are not given the actual question until the day of the test, where they then apply their knowledge of the topic and creative problem-solving skills to present possible solutions to the given future problem scenario. TJ admissions testers can use these competitions, as well as many others, as models for crafting a less preparable admissions test.</p>
<p><strong>Provide school profiles in each application to provide a more thorough understanding of the opportunities available to each applicant.</strong></p>
<p>The opportunities available at middle schools across Fairfax County and surrounding counties differ considerably. Many schools do not have the same opportunities for STEM clubs, and it will take time to implement new STEM clubs at middle schools throughout the county. Some middle schools, such as Longfellow - a prominent feeder school - have well-established Science Olympiad programs and computer classes while others do not. This severely limits the opportunity each student has to demonstrate their interest in STEM. To ensure that as much context as possible is given for each applicant, we propose sending a &ldquo;school profile&rdquo; in each application. These school profiles would detail the extracurricular opportunities given at each school. For example, if a student lacked Science Olympiad experience at a school that did not have a Science Olympiad, that should not be held against them. This would be used solely for context - we cannot ensure that if the program did exist, the student would participate in it.</p>
<h1><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h1>
<p>We acknowledge that there is not an all-encompassing solution to foster a diverse learning environment at TJ. Superficial solutions may produce favorable results in the short-term, but they fail to properly address the root issue. The process will be long and tough, but with action from every corner of the community, it can be achieved.</p>
<p>We believe that instead of hastily trying to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; in more diversity at TJ, we should be starting from a fundamental level to make education an experience that allows everyone an equal opportunity; only then will diversity within the TJ community flourish naturally.</p>{{form.message}}<br />
<p><strong>We hope the board will reconsider accepting the proposed changes to the TJ Admissions process and seek solutions that will address the root of the diversity issue at our school. <br />Thank you.</strong></p><br /> Sincerely, <br>{{form.name}}</div>
